## How to add collaborator to a repository ?
To add a collaborator to a GitHub repository, navigate to the repository's main page. Click on the "Settings" tab located near the top-right corner. In the left sidebar, select "Manage access." On the "Manage access" page, you'll find the "Invite a collaborator" section. Begin typing the collaborator's GitHub username or email address in the provided field. GitHub will suggest matching users. Click on the collaborator's name to add them. You can choose the collaborator's access level (read, write, or admin) and then click "Add." The collaborator will receive an invitation, and once accepted, they'll gain access to the repository.

## GitHub Actions:
GitHub Actions is an automation and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform by GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows, tasks, and processes directly within your repositories. With GitHub Actions, you can set up workflows triggered by various events like pushes, pull requests, or external triggers. Workflows are defined in YAML files and can include steps like building, testing, and deploying your code. These workflows run in isolated environments, called runners, which can be hosted by GitHub or self-hosted. You can use pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace or create your custom actions to modularize your workflows. GitHub Actions streamlines your development process by automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistent code quality and deployment procedures.

## GitHub Pages:
GitHub Pages is a web hosting service provided by GitHub that enables you to publish static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. It's ideal for personal websites, project documentation, and other simple web pages. To use GitHub Pages, create a new branch called "gh-pages" or configure your repository settings to publish from the "docs" folder. Once your code and content are ready, GitHub automatically builds and deploys your site whenever you push changes to the designated branch. You can choose between user or project sites, which have different URL formats. GitHub Pages supports custom domains and HTTPS encryption, making it easy to create professional and secure websites with minimal configuration.

## GitHub CLI:
GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool provided by GitHub that allows you to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more using the command line. It provides a convenient way to manage your GitHub workflow without leaving the terminal. With GitHub CLI, you can create repositories, manage issues and pull requests, and even interact with GitHub Actions workflows. It supports both personal access tokens and SSH authentication for secure communication with GitHub. The CLI uses a simple syntax, making it easy to integrate with scripts and automate repetitive tasks. It enhances developer productivity by enabling efficient GitHub interactions directly from the command line interface.
