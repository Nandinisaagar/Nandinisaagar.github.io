## How to Create a Repository on GitHub ?
To create a repository on GitHub, log in to your GitHub account and click the "+" sign at the top right of the page. Select "New repository" from the dropdown. Give your repository a name, add an optional description, choose visibility (public or private), and select initialization with a README file. Click "Create repository," and you're done! Your new repository is ready for code, documentation, and collaboration.

## How to Fork a Repository ?
To fork a repository on GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page. Choose your user account as the destination for the fork. GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account. You'll now have your own version of the repository that you can modify without affecting the original. You can clone your fork to your local machine, make changes, and then submit pull requests to contribute your changes back to the original repository.

## How to Create a new branch ?
To create a new branch in Git, first ensure you're in the repository's main directory using the terminal. Use the command `git checkout -b branch-name` to simultaneously create and switch to the new branch. Replace "branch-name" with your desired branch name. This isolates your work from the main branch. Make your changes, then use `git add .` to stage them and `git commit -m "Commit message"` to commit them. Your changes are now saved in the new branch.

## How to Create a Pull Request ?
To create a pull request on GitHub, first fork the repository you want to contribute to. Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b branch-name`. Make and commit your changes, then push the branch to your fork with `git push origin branch-name`. On GitHub, navigate to your fork's repository and click "Compare & pull request." Select the base and compare branches, add a title and description, and click "Create pull request." Your changes will be reviewed, discussed, and potentially merged into the original repository.
